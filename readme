# to get started make your server changes in index.ts, once completed you can compile your changes by calling "npx tsc ./src/index.ts"

# this will generate your node file.

# to run your server call node ./src/index.js and head over to localhost: 3000 in your browser or http client.

# you can also just call npm run start to generate the js files and start your server.
